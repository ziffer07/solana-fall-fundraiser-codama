## Todo 3

The `fundraiser` and `vault` are optional during `initialize` stage because codama can derive fundraiser from maker and vault from fundraiser. But for `contribute`, we need it because `fundraiser` used `fundraiser.maker` as seed which is data in `fundraiser` account and codama cannot know that without having fundraiser, similar for `vault` codama need to decode `mint_to_raise`.
